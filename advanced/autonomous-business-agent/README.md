# 🤖 Autonomous Business Agent (AI Execution System)

An **AI-powered autonomous agent system** that performs multi-step reasoning, task planning, and execution logging while answering user business questions using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.

The system simulates a real AI worker that can think, plan, retrieve knowledge, and generate structured responses using an LLM.

Built using:
- 🧠 SentenceTransformers (Embeddings)
- 🗄️ ChromaDB (Vector Database)
- 📄 PyPDF (Document Processing)
- 🤖 OpenAI Agents SDK (Response Layer)
- ⚡ Python + UV

---

## 🚀 Features 

- 🧠 Multi-step reasoning (Think → Retrieve → Answer pipeline)
- 📋 Task planning system for structured execution
- 📜 Execution logs with timestamps
- 🔍 Semantic retrieval using ChromaDB
- 📄 PDF-based knowledge base (RAG integration)
- 🤖 LLM-powered response generation (Gemini / OpenAI Agents SDK)
- ⚡ CLI-based interactive agent system
- 🧩 Modular agent architecture

“We implemented a tool abstraction layer (rag_tool.py) to decouple retrieval logic from agent reasoning, enabling modular expansion into multi-agent systems.”

## ⚙️ How It Works


### 1. User Input

The user enters a business-related query in the CLI.

### 2. Agent Planning

The agent creates a structured plan:

- Understand query
- Retrieve relevant context
- Generate final answer

### 3. Retrieval (RAG System)

The query is converted into embeddings and matched with stored vectors in ChromaDB.

### 4. Context Injection

Relevant chunks from the document are retrieved and passed to the agent.

### 5. Execution (LLM Reasoning)

The agent uses an LLM to generate a final answer based on:

- user question
- retrieved context
- system instructions

### 6. Execution Logs

Every step is logged with timestamps:

- planning stage
- retrieval stage
- execution stage
- completion stage

### 📦 Installation

### Clone the Repository

```bash

git clone https://github.com/bismahashmi2/nexe-agent-internship.git


cd advanced

cd autonomous-business-agent

```

### Create Virtual Environment

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate

```

### Install Dependencies
#### Core project dependencies (safe + lightweight)

```bash
uv add pypdf chromadb openai openai-agents python-decouple
```
#### ML / RAG dependencies (installed manually for stability)

```bash
# CPU-only PyTorch (prevents CUDA installation)
uv pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

# Sentence transformer model
uv pip install sentence-transformers 

# Required transformer ecosystem (manual control to avoid conflicts)
uv pip install transformers tokenizers safetensors huggingface-hub

# Scientific libraries
python -m pip install scikit-learn scipy numpy

```

### Run the Project

```bash
python src/main.py

```
