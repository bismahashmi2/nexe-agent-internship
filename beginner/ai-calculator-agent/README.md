# 🧮 AI Calculator Agent (with Memory + Tools)

An **Agentic AI Calculator** built using tool-calling architecture.  
It supports mathematical operations, remembers previous results across runs, and returns structured JSON outputs.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ➕ Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- 🧠 Persistent memory (remembers last result across runs)
- 🔧 Tool-based computation (no direct LLM math)
- 📦 Structured JSON output only
- 🔁 Multi-step chained calculations (e.g., “add 5 to previous result”)

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 1. User Input
User enters a math query like:

what is 5 times 8


---

### 2. Agent Processing
- Detects operation
- Calls appropriate tool (Plus / Multiply / Divide / Subtract)
- Uses memory if required

---

### 3. 🧠 Memory System
- Stores last calculation result in `memory.json`
- Loads it on every run
- Enables chained operations like:

add 2 to previous result


---

### 4. Output Format
Always returns:

```json
{
  "response": "42"
}

```

---

###  Memory System

Memory is stored in:

memory.json

Example:

{
  "last_result": "40"
}

This allows the agent to remember results between different executions.

---

### 🧪 Example Usage

### Run 1
Input: what is 5 times 8
Output: 
{
  "response": "40"
}

### Run 2
Input: add 2 to the previous result
Output: 
{
  "response": "42"
}

---

### 🧰 Tools Used

- Plus Tool ➕
- Subtract Tool ➖
- Multiply Tool ✖
- Divide Tool ➗

All calculations are performed via tools — not directly by the model.
